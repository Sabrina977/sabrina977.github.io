        <h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:45px">Youtube</h1> 

        <p>Youtube is a social media app, it's the biggest company that creators can create videos in, thousands of videos are being uploaded everyday.</p>

        <p>Many people have turned from being unknown to being famous, it gives an amazing opportunity to have a great life</p>

        <p>Youtubers usually turn their comments on on their videos to have people's opinion about their videos</p>

        <p>I will be talking about about Youtubers, Content, and Money</p>

        <h2>Youtubers</h2>

        <p>There are hundereds of thousands of youtubers out there, the biggest youtube channel so far is an Indian channel with the name of T-Series with 188M subscribers.</p>

        <p>However, the biggest youtuber as a person not some company is Pewdiepie with 110M subscribers, he is considered the third biggest youtube channel passed by CocoMelon and of course T-Series.
        </p>

        <p>Youtubers don't necessarily focus on one thing, and they might make give-aways when they reach a milestone, they may make their own website to sell some things like some clothes accessories and maybe books!</p> 

        <p>But as every job, youtubers are different from each other as not every youtuber share the same content, some contents are very hard to rip-off, for example MrBeast as he makes content about money and not everybody can do this type of content</p>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="YT">Content</h2>

        <p>As said before, youtubers are not necessarily the same as they don't always share the same content, therefore, their subscribers' age are different depending of the content that every youtuber makes.</p>

        <P>Youtubers' views differ from one to another depending on their content, their charisma and their way of declamation, for example the scientific content, it kinda can be represented by anybody but not everyone would be able to perfect it, the person has to has a strong personality with throwing some jokes here and there to not make the audience get bored from the content or a specific video, the perfect exampple for this type of content is Vsauce
        </P>

        
        <h3>Types of content:</h3>

        <ul>Gaming</ul>
        <ul>Vlogging</ul>
        <ul>Science</ul>
        <ul>News</ul>
        <ul>Criticism</ul>
        
        <hr>

        <h2 id="YT2">Money</h2>

        <p>Youtube is a special kind of social media as it gives its youtubers money as a reward, it displays ads on their videos so that it gives them money, some youtubers get to make an ad for a company in exchange for money, but youtube itself doesn't give money to whoever has less than 1K subscribers so youtubers gotta work hard to start making money</p>

        <p>Youtube's money differs of course from youtuber to youtuber, it depends on how many views does the video have, what the watch-time for every video is, what devices, and saying specific could make the video demonetized, therefore the video would have less views, and it wouldn't make money</p>
